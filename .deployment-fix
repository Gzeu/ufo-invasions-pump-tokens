# Deployment Fix Applied

## Issue: Conflicting API Routes
Next.js detected conflicting files between pages/ and app/ directories:
- pages/api/leaderboard.ts vs app/api/leaderboard/route.ts
- pages/api/missions/index.ts vs app/api/missions/route.ts  
- pages/api/rewards/index.ts vs app/api/rewards/route.ts

## Solution: Keep Pages Router Structure
- Removed src/app/api/ directory completely
- Keeping pages/api/ structure (standard for Next.js 14)
- All API routes now in pages/api/ only

## Status: Ready for Deployment
This fix resolves the Next.js build conflict.
Vercel deployment should succeed now.
