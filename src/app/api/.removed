# API Routes Moved to pages/api/

All API routes have been consolidated to pages/api/ structure to resolve Next.js 14 conflicts.

This directory was causing deployment failures due to duplicate route definitions.

Date: 2025-09-29
Fix: Removed src/app/api/ completely
Structure: All APIs now in pages/api/ only
