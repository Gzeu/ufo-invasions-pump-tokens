# 🧪 GPZ-81: Synchronization Smoke Test

*Created: September 29, 2025 - 9:20 AM EEST*

## 🎯 Test Purpose

This smoke test validates the cross-platform synchronization between Linear, GitHub, and Notion for the UFO Invasions Pump Tokens project.

## 📋 Test Scenario

### 🔗 Linear Integration Test
- **Issue ID**: GPZ-81
- **Issue Title**: Cross-Platform Synchronization Linear ↔ Notion ↔ GitHub
- **Expected Behavior**: This commit should trigger GitHub Actions workflow

### 📄 Notion Integration Test
- **Database**: UFO Invasions Task Tracker
- **Task Entry**: Should update with GitHub link and "In Progress" status
- **Expected Fields**: Linear ID, Status, GitHub Link, Tags updated

### 🚀 GitHub Actions Test
- **Workflow**: sync-platforms.yml
- **Triggers**: push to feature branch with GPZ-XX commit message
- **Expected**: Workflow runs, extracts Linear ID, attempts Notion update

## 📊 Validation Checklist

### ✅ Automated Validation
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow triggered by this commit
- [ ] Linear ID "GPZ-81" extracted from commit message
- [ ] Notion API call attempted (check workflow logs)
- [ ] No fatal errors in sync-platforms workflow

### 👁️ Manual Validation
- [ ] Check [GitHub Actions](../../actions) for workflow run
- [ ] Verify [Linear GPZ-81](https://linear.app/gpz/issue/GPZ-81) received comment
- [ ] Check [Notion Task](https://www.notion.so/27dc2a544835819b8061cf62277eca80) for updates
- [ ] Confirm sync timing (should be < 5 minutes)

## 🕰 Test Timeline

| Step | Expected Time | Action |
|------|---------------|--------|
| Commit Push | Immediate | This commit triggers workflow |
| Workflow Start | < 30 seconds | GitHub Actions begins processing |
| API Calls | 1-2 minutes | Linear and Notion API updates |
| Status Sync | < 5 minutes | All platforms reflect changes |

## 📝 Test Results

*To be filled after workflow execution:*

### ✅ Success Indicators
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow completed successfully
- [ ] Linear GPZ-81 received GitHub PR comment
- [ ] Notion task status updated to "In Progress"
- [ ] All sync operations completed within SLA

### ❌ Failure Indicators
- [ ] Workflow failed due to missing secrets
- [ ] API authentication errors
- [ ] Database not found errors
- [ ] Sync timeout (>5 minutes)

## 🔗 Next Steps After Test

### If Successful ✅
1. Merge this PR to main
2. Create additional test PRs for other Linear issues
3. Monitor sync performance over 24h
4. Enable bi-directional sync features

### If Failed ❌
1. Check GitHub Actions logs for specific errors
2. Verify secrets configuration in repository settings
3. Test Linear/Notion API access manually
4. Debug workflow YAML syntax
5. Retry with fixes

## 📊 Metrics to Track

- **Sync Latency**: Time from GitHub event to platform updates
- **Sync Accuracy**: Percentage of successful synchronizations
- **Error Rate**: Failed sync attempts per 100 operations
- **Coverage**: Percentage of issues/PRs properly linked

---

**🔍 Note**: This test file will be updated with actual results after the workflow runs. The synchronization system should automatically link this commit to Linear GPZ-81 and update the corresponding Notion task.

**📝 Manual Test Instructions**: 
1. Monitor [GitHub Actions](../../actions) for workflow execution
2. Check Linear GPZ-81 for new comments
3. Verify Notion task database update
4. Document any failures or performance issues
